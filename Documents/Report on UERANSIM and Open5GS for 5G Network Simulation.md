**Report on UERANSIM and Open5GS for 5G Network Simulation**

**1. Introduction:**

The deployment and testing of 5G networks require sophisticated tools to simulate real-world scenarios and assess the performance of network components. Two key open-source projects, UERANSIM and Open5GS, provide comprehensive solutions for simulating the User Equipment (UE) and the core network components of a 5G network, respectively. This report aims to document the installation, configuration, and utilization of these software components to replicate and simulate a 5G network environment.

**2. UERANSIM Overview:**

UERANSIM is an open-source project designed to simulate the behavior of 5G UEs. It allows researchers and developers to emulate various UE functionalities, facilitating testing and analysis of the Radio Access Network (RAN). The following steps outline the installation and configuration process:

**2.1 Installation:**

- Clone the UERANSIM repository from GitHub.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/aligungr/UERANSIM
  ```

- Navigate to the UERANSIM directory and execute the build script.
  ```
  cd UERANSIM
  ./build.sh
  ```

**2.2 Configuration:**

- Edit the configuration files to specify the desired UE parameters, such as PLMN, TAC, and initial UE identity.

- Customize the mobility and radio configuration parameters for specific test scenarios.

**2.3 Utilization:**

- Launch UERANSIM with the configured settings.
  ```
  ./nr-ue -c <path_to_config_file>
  ```

- Monitor the simulation output for UE registration and communication events.

**3. Open5GS Overview:**

Open5GS is an open-source 5G core network implementation that supports various components like AMF, SMF, UPF, and more. It enables the creation of a complete 5G core network for testing and development purposes. The following outlines the installation and configuration process:

**3.1 Installation:**

- Clone the Open5GS repository from GitHub.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs
  ```

- Navigate to the Open5GS directory and execute the build script.
  ```
  cd open5gs
  make
  ```

**3.2 Configuration:**

- Configure the Open5GS components by editing the respective configuration files (e.g., amf.yaml, smf.yaml, upf.yaml).

- Specify network-related parameters such as PLMN, N3 interfaces, and network slices.

**3.3 Utilization:**

- Start each Open5GS component with the configured settings.
  ```
  ./bin/amf
  ./bin/smf
  ./bin/upfd
  ```

- Monitor the logs to ensure proper initialization and interaction between core network elements.

**4. Integration of UERANSIM and Open5GS:**

To simulate end-to-end communication, integrate UERANSIM with Open5GS by configuring UERANSIM to connect to the Open5GS core network. Ensure that the parameters for the N3 interface in both UERANSIM and Open5GS are aligned.

**5. Conclusion:**

This report provides a comprehensive guide for installing, configuring, and utilizing UERANSIM and Open5GS to simulate a 5G network environment. Researchers and developers can leverage these tools for testing and optimizing 5G network components in a controlled and reproducible environment. Continuous collaboration and community support are crucial for the improvement and evolution of these open-source projects.
