In this sprint, I was involved in installing virtual box, linux machine ubuntu, install Open5GS and UERANSIM in my computer.
We faced challenges in installing Open5gs and found solutions to it.

Download virtual box from https://www.virtualbox.org/.
Download installer
Go to ubuntu website https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop and download vrsion 22.04
Open VirtualBox. Click on "New" to create a new virtual machine. Enter a name for your VM and choose "Linux" as the type and "Ubuntu" as the version.
Allocate RAM to the VM (until its green). Create a virtual hard disk. Create a user account and complete the installation.
No challenges were faced in the installation until now.

Open5GS is an open-source project focused on implementing the 3GPP 5G core network specifications. It includes essential components of a 5G core network,AMF SMF, UPF,etc
3GPP is compatible with the 5G specifications outlined by the global telecommunications standards organization.
Open5GS supports various protocols and interfaces, including NGAP (Next-Generation Application Part), N1, N2, N3 interfaces.
We followed Quickstart process for installing Open5GS - https://open5gs.org/open5gs/docs/guide/01-quickstart/

Challenges faced:
$ sudo apt install -y mongodb-org
This command showed Error : No mongoDB package found
Time taken to research and resolve - 6 hours
Solution found :
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt-key list | grep mongodb-server-6.0.gpg

Then we installed Open5GS successfully.
Next step : Installation of WebUI of Open5GS
The WebUI allows you to interactively edit subscriber data. 
Much Configuration changes were not required as of now because we use local gNB from UERANSIM:

No challenges were faced on installing UERANSIM.
