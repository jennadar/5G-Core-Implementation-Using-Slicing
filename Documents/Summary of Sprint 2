In this sprint, I was involved in installing virtual box, linux machine ubuntu, install Open5GS and UERANSIM in my computer.
We faced challenges in installing Open5gs and found solutions to it.

Download virtual box from https://www.virtualbox.org/.
Download installer
Go to ubuntu website https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop and download vrsion 22.04
Open VirtualBox. Click on "New" to create a new virtual machine. Enter a name for your VM and choose "Linux" as the type and "Ubuntu" as the version.
Allocate RAM to the VM (until its green). Create a virtual hard disk. Create a user account and complete the installation.
No challenges were faced in the installation until now.

Open5GS is an open-source project focused on implementing the 3GPP 5G core network specifications. It includes essential components of a 5G core network,AMF SMF, UPF,etc
3GPP is compatible with the 5G specifications outlined by the global telecommunications standards organization.
Open5GS supports various protocols and interfaces, including NGAP (Next-Generation Application Part), N1, N2, N3 interfaces.
We followed Quickstart process for installing Open5GS - https://open5gs.org/open5gs/docs/guide/01-quickstart/

Step 1 : Installing Mongo DB

Import the public key used by the package management system.
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install gnupg
$ curl -fsSL https://pgp.mongodb.com/server-6.0.asc | sudo gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg --dearmor

Step 2 : Install the MongoDB packages.

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y mongodb-org
$ sudo systemctl start mongod (if '/usr/bin/mongod' is not running)
$ sudo systemctl enable mongod (ensure to automatically start it on system boot)

Challenges faced:

$ sudo apt install -y mongodb-org
This command showed Error : No mongoDB package found
Time taken to research and resolve - 6 hours
Solution found :
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt-key list | grep mongodb-server-6.0.gpg

Step 3:  Install Open5GS

$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:open5gs/latest
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install open5gs
We installed Open5GS successfully.

Step 4: Installation of WebUI of Open5GS - Node.js is required to install the WebUI of Open5GS

The WebUI allows you to interactively edit subscriber data. 
 # Download and import the Nodesource GPG key
 $ sudo apt update
 $ sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg
 $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
 $ curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/gpgkey/nodesource-repo.gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/nodesource.gpg

 # Create deb repository
 $ NODE_MAJOR=20
 $ echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/nodesource.gpg] https://deb.nodesource.com/node_$NODE_MAJOR.x nodistro main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list

 # Run Update and Install
 $ sudo apt update
 $ sudo apt install nodejs -y

Step 4: Configure Open5gs

Much Configuration changes were not required as of now because we use local gNB from UERANSIM.Default configuration remains:
MongoDB   = 127.0.0.1 (subscriber data) - http://localhost:9999

UDR-sbi   = 127.0.0.20:7777 for 5G SBI

No challenges were faced on installing UERANSIM.

My knowledge on UERANSIM - It is an emulator for 5G User Equipment (UE). It simulates various scenarios and interactions with a 5G core network. 
It is used for testing and development purposes, experimenting with 5G features, troubleshooting issues, and simulating different network scenarios.

Step 5: Setup 5G core SA
We need to modify 5G AMF config to support your PLMN and TAC.
