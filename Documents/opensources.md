Originally known as OpenSER, it was created in 2001 by Daniel-Constantin Mierla and released under an open-source license in 2002. The project was later renamed to Kamailio in 2008 to reflect its expanded scope beyond SIP Express Router (SER).

Here are some key aspects and features of Kamailio:

1. *SIP Proxy, Registrar, and Location Server*: Kamailio acts as a SIP proxy, handling routing of SIP signaling messages between SIP user agents (clients) and other SIP entities. It can also function as a registrar, responsible for authenticating and authorizing users, as well as managing their registration information.

2. *Load Balancing and Failover*: Kamailio can distribute SIP traffic across multiple backend servers to balance the load and ensure high availability. It supports various load-balancing algorithms and provides mechanisms for failover in case of backend server failures.

3. *Routing and Dialplan*: Kamailio offers powerful routing capabilities, allowing administrators to define complex routing logic based on various criteria such as SIP headers, source/destination IP addresses, user credentials, etc. This makes it highly customizable for different deployment scenarios.

4. *Security Features*: Security is a critical aspect of any SIP infrastructure, and Kamailio includes features such as traffic encryption (TLS), authentication, access control lists (ACLs), and protection against common SIP attacks like SIP flooding, spoofing, and DoS attacks.

5. *Integration and Extensibility*: Kamailio is designed to be highly extensible and supports integration with various external systems and protocols. It provides a rich set of APIs for scripting and developing custom modules in languages like Lua, Python, JavaScript, etc., enabling developers to add new functionality or integrate with third-party services.
