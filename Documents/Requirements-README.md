<h3 align="Left">2.1.1 Creation of Virtual machines for both 5Gcore and UERANSIM  </h3>

Open VirtualBox: Launch the VirtualBox application on your computer.
Click "New": In the VirtualBox main window, click on the "New" button to create a new virtual machine.
Set Name and Type: Provide a name for your virtual machine (e.g., 5Gcore_VM), select the type (Linux), and choose the version that matches your operating system.
Allocate Memory: Specify the amount of RAM for the virtual machine. For 5G core and UERANSIM, allocate sufficient memory based on your system requirements.
Create a Virtual Hard Disk: Create a virtual hard disk and choose the size. Allocate enough space for the operating system and applications.
Click "Create" and "Create" again to confirm.
Repeat the process to create another virtual machine for UERANSIM.

<h3 align="Left">2.1.2 Install Operating Systems</h3>

Start the Virtual Machines: Select the virtual machines you created and click "Start" to power them on.
Install Operating System: Follow the on-screen instructions to install the operating system on each virtual machine. This could involve mounting an ISO file with the installation media and going through the installation process.


<h3 align="Left">2.1.3. Go to Network settings in virtual box to enable Adapters 1 and 2 </h3>

Select a Virtual Machine: Choose one of the virtual machines (e.g., 5Gcore_VM) and go to the "Settings."
Navigate to "Network": In the VM settings, go to the "Network" tab.
Enable Adapter 1: Check the "Enable Network Adapter" box. Choose "Bridged Adapter" from the drop-down menu. This will allow the VM to connect to the physical network.
Enable Adapter 2: Click on "Adapter 2" and check the "Enable Network Adapter" box. Choose "Host-Only Adapter" from the drop-down menu. This creates a private network between the two virtual machines.
Apply and Save: Click "OK" to apply the changes and save the settings.
Repeat the process for the UERANSIM virtual machine.

<h3 align="Left">2.3.2 Installation of Open5GS in our Ubuntu on VM.</h3>
Installing Open5GS on Ubuntu involves several steps, including installing dependencies, compiling the source code, and configuring the system. Below is a general guide to help installing Open5GS:

```
#easy way to install Open5GS in ubuntu
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:open5gs/latest
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install open5gs
```
Ensure that the Open5GS components are running without errors. Check the terminal outputs for any error messages.

<h2 align="Left">2.4 Installation of WebUI of Open5GS</h2>

**Node.js is mandatory for installing WebUI of Open5GS **

Ensure that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your system. You can typically install them using your system's package manager.
```
#Installing Node.js
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install curl
$ curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt install nodejs
```
WebUI is a web interface that allows you to get access to user (subscriber) DB of Open5GS where you can add new user or change information for existing UE (subscribers).

```
#Installing WebUI of Open5GS
$ curl -fsSL https://open5gs.org/open5gs/assets/webui/install | sudo -E bash -
```

<h2 align="Left">2.6 Installation of Next Cloud</h2>


Nextcloud has been set up on the Virtual Machine 5 to enable seamless file sharing among users. Moreover, the Firefox browser has been configured within the Virtual Machine 5 to manage both admin and user profiles on the Nextcloud server. Access to the admin interface of the Nextcloud server is available through the following URL: https://10.8.2.15/nextcloud/, where the IP address 10.8.2.15 corresponds to VM 5 hosting the Nextcloud server installation. Upon admin registration in Nextcloud, two user profiles are created to facilitate file sharing services. These profiles are designated for usage by two distinct User Equipments and are linked with slice identifiers SST1, SD1, and SST1, SD2.

Linux command to install NextCloud: 

```
git clone https://github.com/RedxLus/Nextcloud-Script.git 

cd Nextcloud-Script 

sudo bash Nextcloud-Script/Nextcloud-Script.sh
```
