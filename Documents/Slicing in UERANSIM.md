# How to Do Slicing in UERANSIM

UERANSIM is an open-source project for 5G RAN (Radio Access Network) and Core Network simulation and testing. Slicing in UERANSIM refers to the capability of dividing the network resources into multiple virtual networks known as slices, each catering to specific types of services or users. Below, I'll outline the steps to achieve slicing in UERANSIM:


## 1. Configure Network Slicing

UERANSIM provides configuration files to set up various network parameters, including slicing. Navigate to the `UERANSIM/config` directory, where you'll find configuration files such as `nr_enb_0.yaml` and `nr_amf.yaml`. These files contain parameters related to the eNB (gNB in 5G), AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function), and other network elements.

## 2. Modify Configuration Files

Open the configuration files related to the components you want to configure for slicing. For example, if you want to configure the gNB for slicing, open the `nr_enb_0.yaml` file in a text editor. Within this file, you'll find various parameters related to the gNB configuration.

## 3. Define Slices

Look for parameters or sections within the configuration file that allow you to define slices. Depending on the version of UERANSIM you're using, the specific parameters might vary. However, typically, you'll find options to define slice IDs, slice types (e.g., URLLC, eMBB, mMTC), and QoS (Quality of Service) parameters for each slice.

## 4. Configure Slice Parameters

For each slice, specify the required parameters such as slice ID, slice type, maximum bandwidth, latency requirements, and other QoS parameters. These parameters will determine the characteristics and capabilities of each slice.

## 5. Save Configuration Changes

After defining and configuring the slices according to your requirements, save the changes to the configuration files.

## 6. Start UERANSIM

Now, start UERANSIM using the provided scripts or commands. Navigate to the `UERANSIM` directory in your terminal or command prompt and execute the appropriate command to start the simulation. Depending on your configuration, UERANSIM will initialize the network elements with the specified slicing parameters.

## 7. Monitor Slicing Performance

Once the simulation is running, you can monitor the performance of the network slices using UERANSIM's logging and monitoring features. This allows you to observe how the network resources are allocated and utilized across different slices.

By following these steps, you can configure slicing in UERANSIM and simulate a network environment with multiple virtual slices tailored to specific use cases or services. Keep in mind that the specific steps and parameters may vary based on the version of UERANSIM you're using and your specific requirements. Always refer to the project documentation and resources for detailed guidance.
