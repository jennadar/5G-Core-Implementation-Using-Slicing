# 5G Environment with Service-Based Architecture (SBA)

Creating a graphical representation of a typical 5G environment with Service-Based Architecture (SBA) involves visualizing key components such as UEs (User Equipment), RAN (Radio Access Network), and the core network elements including AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function), SMF (Session Management Function), UPF (User Plane Function), and NFV (Network Function Virtualization). Below is a simple diagram to help illustrate these components:

## Components and Key Elements

- **UE (User Equipment):** Represents the end-user device, such as a smartphone or IoT device.

- **RAN (Radio Access Network):** Represents the radio infrastructure responsible for wireless communication with UEs.

- **AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function):** Manages mobility and access for UEs within the 5G network.

- **SMF (Session Management Function):** Manages the establishment, modification, and termination of sessions for UEs.

- **UPF (User Plane Function):** Handles the user data traffic, forwarding packets between the UE and external data networks.

- **NFV (Network Function Virtualization):** Represents the concept of virtualizing network functions to improve scalability, flexibility, and resource utilization.
