<h1 align="Left">2. General Architecture </h1>

This section explains the basic architecture of 5G network core.

![image](https://github.com/FRA-UAS/mobcomwise23-24-team_gen5_designers/blob/main/Figures/Architecture/General_architecture.jpeg)

<a id="Open5GS"></a>
<h2 align="Left">2.1: Open5GS </h2>
Open5GS is an open-source implementation of 5G Core Network (5GC) and EPC (Evolved Packet Core), designed to provide a platform for researchers, developers, and operators to experiment, test, and deploy 5G networks. It offers a flexible and modular architecture, allowing for customization and extension to meet various deployment scenarios and requirements. Open5GS aims to promote innovation and collaboration in the 5G ecosystem by providing an accessible and interoperable framework for building next-generation mobile networks. 

<a id="UERANSIM"></a>
<h2 align="Left">2.2: UERANSIM </h2>
UERANSIM is an open-source 5G UE & 5G RAN (gNodeB) implementation. It can be considered as a 5G mobile phone and a base station in basic terms. There are 3 main interfaces in UE/RAN perspective,  

- Control Interface (between RAN and AMF) 

- User Interface (between RAN and UPF) 

- Radio Interface (between UE and RAN).  

UERANSIM supports to run with Open5GS and Free5GC 5G Core networks. We can connect UERANSIM to one of these 5G Core networks and test the functionality. 

<a id="slicing"></a>
<h2 align="Left">2.3: Network Slicing </h2>
Network slicing is a fundamental concept in 5G networks that allows the creation of multiple virtual networks, each tailored to serve specific types of applications, services, or customers. It enables the efficient allocation of network resources and the customization of network behavior to meet diverse requirements, such as ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), massive machine type communication (mMTC), and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB).

<h2 align="Left">6.2 SMF to UPF Connection Establishment. </h2>

After the configurations of the components of 5GC in Open5GS, to receive the changes in the machine we need to restart the 5GC services as mentioned below. 


In U-Plane

```
$ sudo systemctl stop open5gs-smfd
$ sudo systemctl stop open5gs-amfd
$ sudo systemctl stop open5gs-nrfd
$ sudo systemctl stop open5gs-scpd
$ sudo systemctl stop open5gs-ausfd
$ sudo systemctl stop open5gs-udmd
$ sudo systemctl stop open5gs-pcfd
$ sudo systemctl stop open5gs-nssfd
$ sudo systemctl stop open5gs-bsfd
$ sudo systemctl stop open5gs-udrd
$ sudo systemctl restart open5gs-upfd

sudo /bin/open5gs-upfd -c /etc/open5gs/upf1.yaml 
sudo /bin/open5gs-upfd -c /etc/open5gs/upf2.yaml 

```

As multiple SMFs need to be implemented, these services are made to run separately.

```
$ sudo systemctl stop open5gs-smfd
$ sudo systemctl stop open5gs-upfd
$ sudo systemctl restart open5gs-amfd
$ sudo systemctl restart open5gs-nrfd
$ sudo systemctl restart open5gs-scpd

$ sudo /bin/open5gs-smfd -c /etc/open5gs/smf1.yaml
$ sudo /bin/open5gs-smfd -c /etc/open5gs/smf2.yaml
$ sudo /bin/open5gs-smfd -c /etc/open5gs/smf3.yaml
$ sudo /bin/open5gs-smfd -c /etc/open5gs/smf4.yaml

```


After restarting the 5G components, we have depicted the working of the architecture through Wireshark traces captured at Service Based Interfaces.

<a id="smf1-up1">
<h3 align="Left">6.2.1: SMF1 to UPF1 connection Establishment. </h3>

```
sudo /bin/open5gs-smfd -c /etc/open5gs/smf1.yaml 
sudo /bin/open5gs-smfd -c /etc/open5gs/smf2.yaml 
```

After running the above commands you will establish a PFCP connection as shown in the image below.

<h2 align="Left">6.3 Running UERAN </h2>
<h3 align="Left">6.3.1: NG Setup between gNB1 to AMF </h3>

Once the 5GC is up and running, initialization of the gNB1 & UE1 can be performed by the following
commands in the UERANSIM/build directory respectively.

To run gnb - `sudo build/nr-gnb -c config/open5gs-gnb1.yaml`

To ensure the successful connection between 5GC and gnb, we need to receive `NG connection successful` in the same terminal.

<h1 align="Left">7. Network Slicing. </h1>

This section Includes all the network slicing that was performed.

<h2 align="Left">7.1: Next Cloud. </h2>

The NextCloud File Hosting server has been implemented on an IP subnet 10.8.2.15 in the User Plane 2. The users who are connected to the 5G Core via ‘internet’ DNN will be able to access the NextCloud server by pinging to the server IP. 

<a id="slice1">
<h3 align="Left">7.1: Creation on Users in Next Cloud (Server)</h3>

![image](https://github.com/FRA-UAS/mobcomwise23-24-team_gen5_designers/blob/main/Figures/DataNetwork/nextcloud/nectcloud_Usercreations.png)

Below series of steps are involved in accessing the file-sharing service:

1. NG Connection establishment between gNB and 5GC-Control Plane.  

2. PDU session establishment between U-Plane 1 and UE1.  

3. PDU session establishment between U-Plane 2 and UE2.  

4. The IP address for the ‘uesimtun0’ interfaces of both the UEs are shown in Table 7:  

| UE | IP of interface uesimtun0  | Slice used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UE1 | 10.45.0.4  | SST:1, SD:1 |
| UE2 | 10.46.0.2 | SST:1, SD:2 |

5. Once the UEs are assigned the IP addresses on the ‘uesimtun0’ interface then the ‘nr-binder’ tool
available as a part of UERANSIM is used to access the NextCloud server via a web browser already
installed in both UE1 and UE2 using the below command:

```
cd UERANSIM/build  

sh nr-binder 10.45.0.4 firefox (for ue1)  

sh nr-binder 10.46.0.2 firefox (for ue2)
```
6. In the browser windows the NextCloud server can be accessed from the URL https://10.8.2.15/nextcloud/ by logging in to users ‘UE1’ and ‘UE2’ already registered in the NextCloud server (10.8.2.15) ‘ue1’ and ‘ue2’ respectively.
